        <h1>Pterodactyl</h1>
        <p>Once again reminiscent of the Jurassic period, the Pterodactyl, or flying dinosaur, is one of the most well-known types of dinosaurs in history.
            A bird dinosaur creature that existed mostly in the African and European regions, the Pterodactyl has captured our imagination as being a magnificent flier. All of that is rather far from the truth.
            There is plenty of modern-day day research that suggests that the Pterodactyl had a unique body structure. It was due to its unique body structure that the Pterodactyl was unable to fly at all.

        <h4>Body description:</h4>
        <p>Pterodactyls, or, more correctly, pterodactyloids, are distinguished from basal pterosaurs by their reduced teeth, tail, and fifth toe. 
            Pterodactyloid metacarpals (palm bones) were more elongated than those of earlier pterosaurs, which instead had elongated phalanges (finger bones). 
            There are also proportional differences in the skull, neck, pelvis, and wing bones. Pterodactyloid genera include Pterodactylus, a Late Jurassic form from Germany with a wingspan ranging from 50 cm (20 inches) to well over 1 metre (3.3 feet).
